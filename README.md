Hosting information about the organization, including a massive, linked calendar that displays every black organization here on campus, a page dedicated for black owned student business and where to find them, another pages uses to archive black owned business within the NOVA and DMV area. A page for all Black Organizations with custom Instagram tags to direct them to each respected page, also including a custom section for Black Greek Letter Organizations.
